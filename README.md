# Reproduce & LMI Extension: Design of Event-Triggered Asynchronous H∞ Filter for Switched Systems Using the Sampled-Data Approach
The titled research article was published in IEEE Access dt: March 31st, 2023  

* As a part of degree fulfillment; MS Systems Engg under the course of EE-605 Robust Control Systems (Term Project); this article is not only reproduced but also LMI-Extension work (example # 3) is added  
* Final Report & Presentation is attached (Group # 03 Bilal Haider & Yasir Kamal)  
* **This article includes two examples which are successfully reproduced; MATLAB Code is attached for each**  
* **Moreover; Example 3 (Extension-LMI): Two-Tank Switched System with LMI-Based H∞ Filter Using (YALMIP + SeDuMi) is added as an extension work and its MATLAB Code is also provided**  
*Note: To Solve Example 3 in MATLAB; YALMIP & SeDuMi are required to be added in the path (Optimization-Solver)*
