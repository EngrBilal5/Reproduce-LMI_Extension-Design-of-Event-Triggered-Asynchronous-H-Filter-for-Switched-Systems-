# Reproduce & LMI Extension: Design of Event-Triggered Asynchronous H∞ Filter for Switched Systems Using the Sampled-Data Approach
The titled research article was published in IEEE Access dt: March 31st, 2023  

As a part of degree fulfillment; MS Systems Engg under the course of Robust Control Systems; this article is not only reproduced but also LMI Extension work (example # 3) added  

**This article includes two examples which are successfully reproduced; MATLAB Code is attached for each**  
**Moreover;Example 3 (Extension-LMI): Two-Tank Switched System with LMI-Based H∞ Filter Using (YALMIP + SeDuMi) is added as an extension work and its MATLAB Code is also provided**  
*Note: To Solve Example 3 in MATLAB; YALMIP & SeDuMi are required (Optimization-Solver)*
